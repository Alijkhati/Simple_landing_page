            <p>
                Beyond its natural beauty, Nepal is a land steeped in rich culture and history. Kathmandu Valley alone boasts seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, each telling stories of centuries-old kingdoms, architecture, and spirituality. The intricate temples of Patan, the historic courtyards of Bhaktapur, and the sacred stupas of Boudhanath and Swayambhunath stand as testaments to the country's spiritual depth. Nepal's festivals—like Dashain, Tihar, and Holi—reflect a vibrant mix of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, celebrated with music, colors, and joy.
